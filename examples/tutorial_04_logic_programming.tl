// Tutorial 04: Relation Declarations with TensorLogic
//
// This tutorial demonstrates declaring relations for logic programming.
// Relations define predicates that can be used for reasoning.
//
// Note: Full logic programming features (rules, queries) are in development.

// Define a simple binary relation with entity types
relation Parent(x: entity, y: entity)

// Define another relation for family relationships
relation Sibling(x: entity, y: entity)

// Relations can have embeddings for neural-symbolic learning
relation Friend(x: entity, y: entity) embed float32[32]

main {
    // Future features:
    // - Define rules: rule Grandparent(X, Z) <- Parent(X, Y), Parent(Y, Z)
    // - Query relations: query Parent(alice, bob)
    // - Learn embeddings during training

    // Currently demonstrates relation declaration syntax
