main {
    // Task planning

}
```

**Potential Value**:

    }
}
```

**Potential Value**:
- Integration with large language models
- Presentation of reasoning evidence
- Guarantee of logical consistency

---

## 4. Areas with Little to No Demand

### 4.1 Image Classification/Object Detection

#### Demand Level: ⭐ (Almost none)

**Reason**: No point in using logical operations

```tensorlogic
// This is meaningless
rule IsCat(image) :-
    HasWhiskers(image),
    HasPointyEars(image),
    HasFur(image)

// Pure CNN is far better
model = CNN()
result = model.classify(image)  // → "cat"
```

**Why Unnecessary**:
- Image features cannot be logically defined (continuous, high-dimensional)
- CNNs already sufficiently accurate
- Low demand for explainability ("looks like a cat" is sufficient)

---

### 4.2 Time Series Prediction

#### Demand Level: ⭐ (Almost none)

**Reason**: Statistical models more appropriate

```tensorlogic
// Stock price prediction, weather forecasting, etc.
// RNN, Transformer more appropriate than logical rules
```

**Why Unnecessary**:
- Causal relationships too complex to express logically
- Time series models (LSTM, Transformer) already powerful
- Limited demand for explainability

---

### 4.3 Generative Tasks (Image Generation, Music Generation)

#### Demand Level: ⭐ (Almost none)

**Reason**: Logic doesn't suit creative tasks

```tensorlogic
// Image generation (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E)
// Music generation (MuseNet)
// Text generation (GPT)
```

**Why Unnecessary**:
- Generative tasks are probabilistic, creative
- Logical constraints get in the way
- GANs and Diffusion Models already powerful

---

## 7. Critical Analysis: Why Hasn't It Become Popular

### 7.1 Existing Problems

#### Problem 1: Complexity

Existing neuro-symbolic frameworks are too complex:

| Framework | Learning Cost | Usability | Implementation Difficulty |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| DeepProbLog | High | Low | High |
| Scallop | High | Medium | High |
| Neural Theorem Prover | Very High | Low | Very High |

**Example**: Implementation in DeepProbLog
```prolog
% Too complex...
nn(digit_recognizer, [X], Y, digit) :: digit(X, Y).
0.9::path(X, Y) :- edge(X, Y).

```

#### Problem 2: Performance

In many cases, pure neural networks are:

#### Problem 3: Ecosystem

PyTorch/TensorFlow ecosystem is too powerful:
- Abundant libraries (torchvision, transformers, etc.)
- Community support (Stack Overflow, GitHub)
- Industrial track record (Google, Facebook, Tesla)

### 7.2 Where TensorLogic Can Win

| Element | Rating | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Simplicity** | ✅ High | More concise than other N-S frameworks |
| **GPU Optimization** | ✅ High | Native support for tensor operations |

## 8. Real Use Case Scenarios

### 8.1 Scenario 1: Drug Discovery (Real Demand)

#### Background

Pharmaceutical companies spend 10-15 years and hundreds of billions of yen on new drug development. If they can discover new indications for existing drugs (repurposing), they can significantly reduce costs and time.

#### Implementation in TensorLogic

```tensorlogic
entity Drug      // 10,000 drugs
entity Protein   // 20,000 proteins
entity Disease   // 5,000 diseases

main {
    with Drug, Protein, Disease {
        load_facts("drugbank.csv")     // Known drug-protein interactions
        load_facts("diseases.csv")     // Disease-protein relationships
        load_facts("side_effects.csv") // Side effect data
    }

    // Rule 1: Drug treats disease by inhibiting related protein
    rule PotentialTreatment(drug: Drug, disease: Disease) :-
        Inhibits(drug, protein),
        CausedBy(disease, protein),
        not SeriousSideEffect(drug, disease)

    // Rule 2: Similar drugs have similar effects
    rule SimilarEffect(drug1: Drug, drug2: Drug) :-
        Inhibits(drug1, protein),
        Inhibits(drug2, protein)

    learn {
        // Learn unknown interactions using embeddings
        // Predict from known drug-disease relationships
        objective: ranking_loss + constraint_loss,
        optimizer: adam(lr: 0.001),
        epochs: 100
    }

    infer {
        // Search for new drug candidates
        PotentialTreatment(aspirin, X)?
        // → Known: headache, inflammation
        // → Inference: heart disease (anticoagulant effect)
        // → Learning: Alzheimer's disease (possible new discovery)
    }
}
```

#### Business Value

| Item | Traditional | TensorLogic |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **New Indication Discovery Time** | 5-10 years | 1-2 years |
| **Cost** | Tens of billions of yen | Hundreds of millions of yen |
| **Success Rate** | 5-10% | 15-20% (estimated) |

**This is actually valuable**: Features pharmaceutical companies truly want

---

### 8.2 Scenario 2: Financial Risk Assessment (Real Demand)

#### Background

Financial institutions are required by regulators to explain the rationale for automated decisions. Black box models cannot comply.

#### Implementation in TensorLogic

```tensorlogic
entity Company
entity Person
entity Transaction

main {
    with Company, Person, Transaction {
        load_facts("companies.csv")
        load_facts("transactions.csv")
        load_facts("relationships.csv")
    }

    // Rule: Money laundering detection
    rule SuspiciousActivity(transaction: Transaction) score :-
        HighAmount(transaction),           // Score: 0.8
        UnusualPattern(transaction),       // Score: 0.7
        LinkedToRiskCompany(transaction)   // Score: 0.9

    // Overall score = weighted average
    // (0.8 * 0.3 + 0.7 * 0.3 + 0.9 * 0.4) = 0.81

    learn {
        // Pattern learning (neural network part)
        // Learn new fraud patterns
    }

    infer {
        // Judgment with explainable reasoning
        SuspiciousActivity(tx_12345)?
        // → Score: 0.81
        // → Reasons:
        //   - HighAmount: $1,000,000 (10x normal)
        //   - UnusualPattern: International transfer at midnight
        //   - LinkedToRiskCompany: Tax haven company
    }
}
```

#### Business Value

| Item | Black Box AI | TensorLogic |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Accuracy** | 90% | 88-92% (comparable) |
| **Explainability** | ❌ None | ✅ Detailed reasons |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | ❌ Difficult | ✅ Possible |
| **Auditability** | ❌ Not possible | ✅ Possible |

**This is also valuable**: Regulators demand explanations

---

### 8.3 Scenario 3: Image Classification (No Demand)

#### Why Unnecessary

```tensorlogic
// This is meaningless
rule IsCat(image) :-
    HasWhiskers(image),
    HasPointyEars(image),
    HasFur(image)

// Problems:
// 1. How to determine HasWhiskers? → Need CNN anyway
// 2. "whiskers AND pointy ears AND fur" is insufficient
// 3. Pure CNN far more accurate
```

**Conclusion**: Zero advantages of logical operations

- Not competing but complementary
- Use PyTorch tensor operations internally?
- Integration with PyTorch ecosystem

**Decision**: Consider in future, independent implementation initially

#### Question 3: Benchmarks

**Which benchmarks to evaluate on**:
- Knowledge graphs: FB15k-237, WN18RR
- Neuro-symbolic AI: CLUTRR, bAbI
- Explainable AI: Custom benchmarks

**Timing**: After Phase 3 completion

### 11.3 Things to Decide in Next Discussion

1. **Details of Learning and Inference Integration**
   - Embedding initialization methods
   - Hyperparameter settings
   - Target accuracy on benchmarks

2. **Adjusting Implementation Priorities**
   - What to minimally include in Phase 1
   - Boundary with Phase 2

3. **Documentation and Tutorial Planning**
   - Content of first tutorial
   - Documentation structure

## Summary

### Conclusion

**Demand for learning and inference using logical operations**:

- ❌ Low across deep learning overall
- ✅ High in specific areas (knowledge graphs, XAI)
- 📈 Possibility of future increase
- 🎯 **Niche but valuable market**

### TensorLogic's Direction

**"Option C-leaning Option B"**:
- Core in research/educational use
- Also consider practical experiments in knowledge graphs/XAI
- Keep possibility of future generalization

### Keys to Success

1. ✅ **Simplicity**: More usable than other N-S frameworks
2. ✅ **GPU Optimization**: Achieve practical speed
3. ✅ **Community**: Collaboration with researchers and educators
4. ✅ **Examples**: Attractive demos that actually work

### Next Steps

1. **Review this document**: Confirm direction
2. **Start Phase 1 implementation**: Establish foundation
3. **Create first tutorial**: Attract users
4. **Collect feedback**: Listen to opinions from early stage
